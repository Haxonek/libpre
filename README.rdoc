== Libpre

This was a project idea of mine which was (for the most part) finished in Aug, 2015.  Although I never hosted it I did finish it, and it served as an image hosting platform like imgur, however the idea was to donate the proceeds to charity.

To keep it simple there were no accounts, however images were compressed and it guessed at images you posted by your ip, so that even without an account you could still look up images you've recently posted.  When I published it, it was hosted/tested on heroku using aws, however again it was always under the free version and unfortunately never served production.
