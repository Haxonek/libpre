    <h3>How it Works</h3>
    <p>The most simple explination of our site is that as users view the images on our site, the ad revenue is split between server/mandatory costs and then donated proportional to the ratio of hits between organization.  (So each time a page is viewed, a hit is recorded for the page and then the revenue is split up proportionally)</p>
    <h3 id="organizations">The Organizations</h3>
    <p>Currently we're only supporting donations to five organizations, although if we grow in poplularity we expect to expand out selection.</p>

    <p>From Wikileak's website:</p>
    <p><blockquote>WikiLeaks is a not-for-profit media organisation. Our goal is to bring important news and information to the public. We provide an innovative, secure and anonymous way for sources to leak information to our journalists (our electronic drop box). One of our most important activities is to publish original source material alongside our news stories so readers and historians alike can see evidence of the truth.  <a href="https://wikileaks.org/About.html" target="_blank">continue reading</a></blockquote></p>
    <h5><a href="https://www.torproject.org/" target="_blank">Tor Project</a></h5>
    <p>From the Tor website:</p>
    <p><blockquote>The Tor network is a group of volunteer-operated servers that allows people to improve their privacy and security on the Internet. Tor's users employ this network by connecting through a series of virtual tunnels rather than making a direct connection, thus allowing both organizations and individuals to share information over public networks without compromising their privacy. Along the same line, Tor is an effective censorship circumvention tool, allowing its users to reach otherwise blocked destinations or content. Tor can also be used as a building block for software developers to create new communication tools with built-in privacy features.<a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en" target="_blank">continue reading</a></blockquote></p>
    <h5><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/" target="_blank">Mozilla Organization</a></h5>
    <p>From Mozilla's website:</p>

We promote the values of an open Internet to the broader world. <br/> <br/>Mozilla is best known for the Firefox browser, but we advance our mission through other software projects, grants and engagement and education efforts such as Mozilla Webmaker.  <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/" target="_blank">continue reading</a></blockquote></p>
